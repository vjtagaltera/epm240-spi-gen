[1] fpga repo

    create a new quartus prime project in the folder with: 
        name: s9p
        top-level design entity: fpga_s9_top

    add all files into the project
    assign device to ep4ce22f17c6
    import csv assignments
    take out pll.v and pll_bb.v
    build.

    create jic for epcs64 on ep4ce22


[2] timing captured by digital-view logic analyzer: 

    clk c2:   12ns                     83.33MHz
    hd hi/lo: 14.22us/7.58us (21.8us)  45.872 kHz
    vd hi/lo:  5.23ms/2.79us (8ms)      125 Hz

    pixels/line: 14.22/12*1000=1280
    lines/frame: 5.23/21.8*1000=240


[3] wiring to the ave board: 

    connect fpga pins to facedet cam pins: 

        G        to       G 10     via green
        VD neg   to      vs 12     via orange
        HD       to      hs 14     via yellow
        clk c2   to     clk 13     via blue
